# Scala-Android-IntelliJ-Project-That-Works
There's apparently a special art to combining Android, Akka, Scala, and Gradle (and thus IntelliJ). Here's a template for Akka 2.3.9, Scala 2.11.7, IntelliJ 15, and Android 23.02. 
  
Import a new project with IntelliJ. Select "Import project from external model...Gradle". Use default wrapper. Finish.
